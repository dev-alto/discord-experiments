# ðŸ¤– discord-experiments

Hello! This is a work-in-progress web application that serves as one of my side-projects. 

It currenttly serves to be a personal multi-purpose Discord bot, one â€” however, that is feature-unique.

## ðŸ“š Command Directory:

### Stable-ish Commands:

âš  Be advised: Currently, all  `/test` prefixed commands interact with the bot's music feature.

`/test` - Requests a new audio track sourced either from a YouT\*be or Spotify URL link, or an internal soundboard track.

> Input: 
> - [voice-channel] (required) - The voice channel the bot will join. Note that this field becomes unused once the bot is already connected somewhere.
> - [link] (required) - The audio source to extract and play.

`/testvolume` - Changes the audio player volume of the bot.

> Input:
> - [volume] (required) - The number from 0 to 5 to set the audio player volume to. I recommend 0.5.

`/testqueue` - Displays the bot's queue in a neat-looking packaged message.

`/testpause` - Pauses the bot's audio player.

`/snipe` - Fun thing.

> Input:
> - [user-mention] (required) - The tango to snipe.

### Not-As-Stable Commands:

`/testskip` - Skips the current track. 

`/timer` - Starts/stops an interally tracked timer, starting from the time the command is first used until the command is used again. Returns the delta time in ms.

This message means my bot is offline. Let me know if you want me to re/start it up.
