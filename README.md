# ðŸ¤– discord-experiments

Hello! This is a work-in-progress web application that serves as one of my many side-projects. 

It currenttly serves to be a personal multi-purpose Discord bot, one â€” however, that is feature-unique.

## ðŸ“š Command Directory:

### âœ… Stable-ish Commands:

âš  Be advised: At this point in development, all  `/test` prefixed commands interact with the bot's audio player feature.

â‡’ `/test` - Requests a new audio track sourced either from a YouT\*be or Spotify URL link, or an internal soundboard track.

> - [voice-channel] (required) - The voice channel the bot will join. Note that this field is unused if the bot is already connected somewhere.
> - [link] (required) - The audio source to extract and play, either a URL or the name of an internal soundboard track.

â‡’ `/testvolume` - Changes the audio player volume of the bot.

> - [volume] (required) - A number from 0 to 5 to set the audio player volume to. I recommend 0.5.

â‡’ `/testqueue` - Displays the bot's queue in a neat-looking packaged message.

â‡’ `/testpause` - Pauses the bot's audio player.

â‡’ `/snipe` - Fun command; utilizes image manipulation tech.

> - [user-mention] (required) - The tango.

### ðŸ”¶ Not-As-Stable Commands:

â‡’ `/testskip` - Skips the current track. (Future plans to allow skipping to a specific index in the queue)

â‡’ `/timer` - The bot starts/stops an interal stopwatch timer, starting from the time the command is first used until the command is called again, then returning the delta time in ms. For debugging.

This message means my bot is offline. Let me know if you want me to re/start it up.
